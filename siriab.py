"""
Enhanced testing support is available in this script.

Prerequisite:
    - The 'pytest' package must be installed.
    - To install: run `pip install pytest`

How to run tests (if pytest is installed):
    1. To run all tests:
       `pytest siriab.py`
    2. To run a specific test case:
       `pytest siriab.py::test_solve_arrow_rotation`

    Available test functions:
        - test_solve_arrow_rotation
        - test_solve_asphalt_patching
        - test_solve_rain_water_tank

If you don't wish to use the enhanced testing option,
you can still run the script as a regular Python file:
    `python siriab.py`
check in the `run_manually` section to run solutions manually as of your choice
